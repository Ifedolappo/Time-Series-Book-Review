Text mining or text analysis, involves the extraction of useful information and insights from text data, in order to find trends, patterns, and relationships among responses. This analysis employs the R programming language to conduct text analysis on a dataset comprising customer-written book reviews. The dataset consists of 11 features, with a particular emphasis on analyzing the “review text” feature. The objective is to uncover patterns in customer book reviews, gaining insights into preferences, sentiments, and recurring themes. Through R-based text analysis, the study aims to inform decision-making in book-related businesses and enhance understanding of customer feedback.
